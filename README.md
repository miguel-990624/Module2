# Modulo2
HTML and CSS module

This Module will have all the learning process i undergo through my training at riwi

Up until now i found out that for a more apropiate use of semantics within the HTML, there is someting called ARIA (Accesible Rich Internet Applications), this will improve the accessibility for the user that need a screen reader.

So... What is ARIA??
-  ARIA, stands for Accesible Rich Internet Applications, not all users can access the web through conventional methods and may require assistance such as a screen readers. ARIA will help those users have a better time navigating through the page. It states the role, state, and purpose of elements within the page, especially the interactive elements, such as custom dropdowns, modals, sliders, etc...
-  It is also important to consider that not all elements on a web page are naturally accessible, like a <buton>, <input>, <a> tags, that state what they are for, but when we create a custome UI component such as a buton being created form a div, this elements the page do not know how to interpret, with ARIA we can fill that gap
